Clone this repository and edit the code in `submission.py`.

### Assignment 2:

In functions: `formula1a`, `formula1b`, and `formula1c`, replace: `raise Exception("Not implemented yet")` with a return statement of the logical expression that represents the commented Sentence defined above each function definition.

In total, 3 lines of code should be replaced - one line in each function.

You should use the `class` definitions in `logic.py` to construct your return statement.

To check your work, run: `python grader.py 1a` (replace 1a with 1b and 1c to check each function).

### Assignment 3:

Follow the same instructions as for Assignment 2, but complete functions `formula2a` and `formula2b` instead (2 lines to replace in total). 

Note: Each output of running `grader.py` on `2a` and `2b`, should contain `END GRADING [2/2 points + 0/0 extra credit]`.
