Clone this repository and edit the code in `submission.py`.
In functions: `formula1a`, `formula1b`, and `formula1c`, replace: `raise Exception("Not implemented yet")` with a return statement of the logical expression that represents the commented Sentence defined above each function definition.
In total, 3 lines of code should be replaced - one line in each function.
You should use the `class` definitions in `logic.py` to construct your return statement.
To check your work, run: `python grader.py 1a` (replace 1a with 1b and 1c to check each function).
